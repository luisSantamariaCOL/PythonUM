### Inheritance

* When we make a new class - we can reuse an existing class and **inherit** all the capabilities of an existing  
class and then add our own little bit to make our new class.  
* Another form of store and reuse
* Write once - reuse many times
* The new class (child) has all the capabilities of the old class (parent) - and then some more
