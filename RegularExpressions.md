# Regular Expressions

* Very powerful and quite cryptic
* Fun once you understand them
* Regular expressions are a language unto themselves
* A language of "marker characters" - programming with characters
* it is kind of an "old school" language - compact

The key with regular expressions is that instead of programming with lines, you are programming actually with characters.

## The Regular Expression Module

* You must import the library using "import re"
* You can use **re.search()** to see if a string matches a regular expression.  
* You can use **re.findall()** to extract portions of a string that match your regular expression.

## Using re.search() Like find()
